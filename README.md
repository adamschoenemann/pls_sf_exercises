# Programming Language Seminar Exercises (ITU)
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for the "Programming Language Seminar"
course at ITU. The exercises for the course are simply lifted from Pierce's excellent
[Software Foundations][1], so this repository also kind of serves as a set of solutions
for that book (even though they changed the book into three separate books so the
assignments were probably shifted around).
